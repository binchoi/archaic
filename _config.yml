  Hi, my name is Bin Choi. I'm a junior backend developer and a third-year student at Yale-NUS College. I am currently studying Computer Science at Aalto University in Finland as an exchange student.

  I enjoy logical problem solving and am deeply fascinated by the intersection of Medicine and Computer Science. Working with <mark>Spring Boot</mark> has taught me the importance of a well-structured MVC framework and Test-Driven Development. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The languages that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>OCaml</mark>, and <mark>Bash/Linux</mark>.

  The idea of being able to create new services that positively impact countless lives is the driving force behind my back-end development journey.

          Transforming habit building into an exciting competition against friends and families.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Building new habits is difficult. Whether it be exercise or reading, it is incredibly easy for a budding habit to die. I started this project in hopes of transforming habit building into an exciting, interactive experience. With the ability to challenge a friend or family to a habit race with real wagers at stake, Habit Racer will not only keep you accountable but invested. 
          
          I encountered many new tools and developed new and existing skills in the process of building this project. These include <mark>Spring Boot</mark>, <mark>AWS</mark> (i.e. EC2, S3, CodeDeploy), <mark>MariaDB</mark>, <mark>JUnit</mark>, <mark>TravisCI</mark>, <mark>Spring Data JPA</mark>, and <mark>Java</mark>. I also experienced the importance of Test-Driven Development, RESTful APIs, and software quality management.

          I contributed to the improvement of accuracy in cancer studies *basically*
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Computer algorithms are heavily relied upon in cancer research, especially in in-vivo studies (e.g. Patient Derived Xenografts). Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art algorithms and tools don't work as well as they should. My research focused on analyzing the performance of these popular tools and developing an original pipeline that implements an Expectation-Maximization algorithm from an Empirical Bayesian perspective with <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, and <mark>Bash</mark>.
