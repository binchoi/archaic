  Hi, my name is Bin Choi, I'm a junior backend developer and a third-year student at Yale-NUS College. I am currently studying Computer Science at Aalto University in Finland as an exchange student.

  I enjoy solving algorithm and statistical problems and am deeply fascinated by the intersection of Medicine and Computer Science. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The tools that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark>, <mark>OCaml</mark>, <mark>Bash/Linux</mark>, and <mark>git</mark>.

          (TO BE CHANGED) I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
